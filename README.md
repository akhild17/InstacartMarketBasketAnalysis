Instacart Market Basket Analysis Project
This project, implemented in Python, explores various machine learning algorithms to analyze market basket data from Instacart. Market basket analysis aims to uncover patterns and relationships within customer purchase behaviors to optimize product placement, promotions, and recommendations.

Key Features:
-Utilized Python's data analysis and machine learning libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and XGBoost.
-Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into customer purchasing habits and product relationships.
-Implemented association rule mining techniques such as Apriori and FP-Growth to identify frequent itemsets and generate actionable rules.
-Explored supervised learning algorithms including decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting to predict customer purchasing behavior.
-Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
-Visualized results using matplotlib and seaborn to communicate findings effectively.
